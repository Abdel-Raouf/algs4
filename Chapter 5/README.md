# Chapter 5: Strings
Investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.

### Sections
* [5.1 String Sorts](Section%201.md) includes LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, and 3-way radix quicksort for sorting arrays of strings.
* [5.2 Tries](Section%202.md) describes R-way tries and ternary search tries for implementing symbol tables with string keys.
* [5.3 Substring Search](Section%203.md) describes algorithms for searching for a substring in a large piece of text, including the classic Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp algorithms.
* [5.4 Regular Expressions](Section%204.md) introduces a quintessential search tool known as grep that we use to search for incompletely specified substrings.
* [5.5 Data Compression](Section%205.md) introduces data compression, where we try to reduce the size of a string to the minimum possible. We present the classic Huffman and LZW algorithms.
