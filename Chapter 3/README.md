# Chapter 3: Searching
Describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, redâ€“black trees, and hash tables.

### Sections
* [3.1 Elementary Symbol Tables](Section%201.md) includes unordered and ordered implementations, using arrays or linked lists.
* [3.2 Binary Search Trees](Section%202.md) describes binary search trees.
* [3.3 Balanced Search Trees](Section%203.md) describes red-black BSTs, a data structure that guarantees logarithmic performance per symbol table operation.
* [3.4 Hash Tables](Section%204.md) describes two classic hashing algorithms: separate chaining and linear probing.
* [3.5 Applications](Section%205.md) introduces the set data type and includes numerous applications of symbol tables and sets.
