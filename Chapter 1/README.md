# Chapter 1: Fundamentals
Introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.

### Sections
* [1.1 Programming Model](Section%201.md) introduces our basic programming model. All of our programs are implemented using a small subset of the Java programming language plus a few of our own libraries for input and output.
* [1.2 Data Abstraction](Section%202.md) emphasizes data abstraction, where we define abstract data types (ADTs). We specify an applications programming interface (API) and then use the Java class mechanism to develop an implementation for use in client code.
* [1.3 Bags, Queues, and Stacks](Section%203.md) considers three fundamental ADTs: the bag, the queue, and the stack. We describe APIs and implementations using resizing arrays and linked lists.
* [1.4 Analysis of Algorithms](Section%204.md) describes our approach to analyzing algorithm performance. The basis of our approach is the scientific method: we develop hypotheses about performance, create mathematical models, and run experiments to test them.
* [1.5 Case Study: Union-Find](Section%205.md) is a case study where we consider solutions to a connectivity problem that uses algorithms and data structures that implement the classic union-find ADT.
