Unofficial Full exercise solutions for Algorithms, 4th edition textbook.

### Notes
I will finish all the exercises in exercise number order.

If you find a mistake, you are welcomed to point out.

### Chapters
* [Chapter 1: Fundamentals](Chapter%201) introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.
* [Chapter 2: Sorting](Chapter%202) considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
* [Chapter 3: Searching](Chapter%203) describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, redâ€“black trees, and hash tables.
* [Chapter 4: Graphs](Chapter%204) surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
* [Chapter 5: Strings](Chapter%205) investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.
* [Chapter 6: Context](Chapter%206.md) highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, operations research, and intractability.
