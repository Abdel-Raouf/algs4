# Chapter 2: Sorting
Considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.

### Sections
* [2.1 Elementary Sorts](Section%201.md) introduces selection sort, insertion sort, and shellsort.
* [2.2 Mergesort](Section%202.md) describes megesort, a sorting algorithm that is guaranteed to run in linearithmic time.
* [2.3 Quicksort](Section%203.md) describes quicksort, which is used more widely than any other sorting algorithm.
* [2.4 Priority Queues](Section%204.md) introduces the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using a binary heap. It also introdues heapsort.
* [2.5 Applications](Section%205.md) describes applications of sorting, including using alternate orderings, selection, the system sort, and stability.
