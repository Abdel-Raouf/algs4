# Chapter 4: Graphs
Surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.

### Sections
* [4.1 Undirected Graphs](Section%201.md) introduces the graph data type, including depth-first search and breadth-first search.
* [4.2 Directed Graphs](Section%202.md) introduces the digraph data type, including topological sort and strong components.
* [4.3 Minimum Spanning](Section%203.md) Trees describes the minimum spanning tree problem and two classic algorithms for solving it: Prim and Kruskal.
* [4.4 Shortest Paths](Section%204.md) introduces the shortest path problem and two classic algorithms for solving it: Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford.
